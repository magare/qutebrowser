Here is the consolidated list of techniques, methods, and concepts.

## Advanced Search & Query Construction

- **Cross-Engine Triangulation**: Query multiple search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) simultaneously and combine results, leveraging engine-specific operators.
- **Exact Phrase Search**: Use quotation marks (`"phrase"`) to force a search for the exact sequence of words, bypassing semantic interpretation.
- **Term Exclusion & Inclusion**: Use the minus sign (`-term`) to remove results containing a specific word and the plus sign (`+term`) to force the inclusion of a word that might be ignored.
- **Wildcard Search**: Use an asterisk (`*`) within a quoted phrase to represent one or more unknown words.
- **Boolean Logic**: Combine terms with a capitalized `OR` and use parentheses `( )` to group complex queries for logical control.
- **Site Restriction**: Limit searches to a specific website (`site:example.com`) or top-level domain (`site:.gov`).
- **File Type Filtering**: Find specific document formats by using `filetype:pdf` or `ext:xls`.
- **HTML Element Targeting**: Search within specific parts of a webpage using `intitle:`, `inurl:`, `intext:`, or `inanchor:`.
- **Proximity Search**: Find pages where terms appear within a specified number of words of each other using `AROUND(X)` or `near:X`.
- **IP Address Search**: Use Bing's `ip:` operator to discover websites hosted at a specific IP address.
- **Specialized Filtering**: Use operators to filter by language (`language:`), location (`loc:`), or pages linking to a specific file type (`contains:`).

## Social Media & People Intelligence (SOCMINT)

- **Identifier Pivoting**: Search for a known identifier (username, email, phone number) across multiple platforms to connect disparate profiles.
- **Platform-Internal Search**: Query directly within a social media site's search bar, as they can reveal profiles by phone number or other data not indexed by external engines.
- **Contextual Name Search**: Combine a person's name with context like their employer, school, or location to narrow results.
- **Contact Syncing Emulation**: Add a target's phone number to your contacts and use the "sync contacts" feature on platforms like Instagram or Facebook to reveal associated profiles.
- **Social Connection Mapping**: Analyze the public friend/follower lists and interactions (comments, tags) of a target's known associates to find the target's profile.
- **Reverse Phone Lookup Integration**: Use specialized people-search services (e.g., Spokeo, Pipl) to link phone numbers to social profiles and personal data.

## Visual Intelligence (Image & Video)

- **Multi-Engine Reverse Image Search**: Search using an uploaded image, URL, or drag-and-drop file across multiple services (e.g., Google Lens, TinEye, Yandex) to find its source and other online appearances.
- **Visual De-anonymization**: Run a reverse image search on a profile picture to discover other accounts or personas using the same image.
- **Chronological Image Tracking**: Use a service like TinEye to sort reverse image search results by date to find the first time an image was indexed online.
- **Image Manipulation Detection**: Compare a search image with its matched results side-by-side to highlight cropping, color changes, or other edits.
- **Video Frame Analysis**: Take a screenshot from a video and perform a reverse image search on the frame to identify the original video, location, or subjects.
- **AI-Powered Image Analysis**: Upload an image to an AI vision model (like Gemini or ChatGPT) and ask natural language questions to identify landmarks, objects, or context.

## Website Deconstruction & Hidden Content

- **Configuration File Analysis**: Automatically fetch and parse a website's `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` files to map its intended structure.
- **`robots.txt` Intelligence**: Treat `Disallow:` entries in `robots.txt` as a list of potentially sensitive directories to investigate, as the protocol is not a security measure.
- **Historical `robots.txt` Review**: Use the Wayback Machine to check past versions of a site's `robots.txt` file for directories that were once disallowed but are now forgotten.
- **Orphan Page Discovery**: Compare the list of URLs from a site's `sitemap.xml` against a list generated by a full site crawl. Any URL in the sitemap but not found by the crawl is an unlinked "orphan" page.

## Temporal Analysis (Web Archives & Caches)

- **Historical Snapshot Viewing**: Use the Wayback Machine to view a calendar of all archived versions of a specific URL.
- **Archived Directory Discovery**: Search a directory with a wildcard in the Wayback Machine (e.g., `example.com/reports/*`) to find all unique pages ever archived within that path.
- **Search Engine Cache Retrieval**: Use the `cache:` operator to view a search engine's most recently indexed version of a page, which can reveal recent changes or provide access to an offline site.
- **Evidence Preservation**: Use a service like the Internet Archive's "Save Page Now" to create a permanent, timestamped, and shareable link to a live webpage.

## Public Records & Specialized Databases

- **Business Registrations**: Query government databases like SAM.gov (US Federal), state Secretaries of State, Companies House (UK), and BRIS (EU).
- **Legal Records**: Search court systems such as PACER (US Federal), state court portals, AustLII (Australia), and EUR-Lex (EU).
- **Property Records**: Investigate city/county databases (e.g., NYC's ACRIS) and national registries like HM Land Registry (UK) or provincial systems in Canada.
- **Intellectual Property**: Search global and national patent/trademark databases like USPTO, Google Patents, WIPO, and the EPO.
- **Academic & Scientific Research**: Access scholarly papers and studies through databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, JSTOR, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore.
- **Government Data**: Explore open datasets and declassified documents via portals like Data.gov (US) and The National Archives.

## Community & Forum Intelligence

- **Reddit User Analysis**: Use `author:username` to find all posts and comments by a user, and combine it with `subreddit:` to target specific communities.
- **Niche Forum Discovery**: Use search footprints like `"topic" inurl:forum` or `"industry name" + "forum"` to find specialized discussion boards.
- **Earnings Call Analysis**: Scrape and index quarterly earnings call transcripts from public companies to extract information on industry trends, challenges, and key personnel.
